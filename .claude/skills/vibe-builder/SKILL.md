The Human wants to build the following application:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow the 6 phases below **in strict order**. Do NOT skip human review checkpoints.

---

## PHASE 1: Research & Product Spec (Human Intel)

**Goal:** Transform the raw idea into detailed technical documentation based on deep research.

### Step 1.1: Deep Research (MANDATORY - BE THOROUGH)

**This step is CRITICAL. Research deeply before writing anything.**

Use WebSearch extensively to research:
- **Market analysis**: Similar products, competitors, what makes them successful/fail
- **User expectations**: What users expect from this type of app, common complaints, must-have features
- **Best practices**: Industry standards, design patterns, UX conventions
- **Technical architecture**: Recommended tech stack, scalability patterns, security considerations
- **Data structures**: Common schemas, database design patterns for this domain
- **UI/UX patterns**: Common layouts, navigation patterns, accessibility standards
- **Docker images**: Search Docker Hub for ready-made images (see table in Step 1.2)

**Research requirements:**
- Perform **at least 5-8 searches** covering different aspects
- Look for **real-world examples** and case studies
- Find **official documentation** for recommended technologies
- Search for **common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Search Docker Hub** for images that provide needed services out-of-the-box

**Synthesize findings** before proceeding - don't just collect links, understand the patterns.

### Step 1.2: Select Technology Stack

**Infrastructure: Docker-First Approach**

Always prioritize using Docker for local development. Search for existing Docker images that provide services out-of-the-box:

| Service Need         | Docker Images to Consider                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Database             | `postgres`, `mysql`, `mongodb`, `redis`        |
| Backend-as-a-Service | `supabase/supabase`, `pocketbase`, `directus`  |
| Auth                 | `keycloak`, `authentik`, `supabase` (has auth) |
| Search               | `getmeili/meilisearch`, `elasticsearch`        |
| Storage              | `minio`, `supabase` (has storage)              |
| Message Queue        | `rabbitmq`, `redis`                            |
| CMS                  | `strapi`, `directus`, `ghost`                  |

**Application Code: Typed Languages Only**

| App Type    | Recommended Stack                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web App     | TypeScript + React/Next.js/Vue              |
| Backend API | TypeScript + Node.js or Python + FastAPI    |
| CLI Tool    | Python (with type hints) or Rust            |
| Mobile App  | TypeScript + React Native or Dart + Flutter |
| Desktop App | TypeScript + Electron or Rust + Tauri       |

If Human specified preferences, use those instead.

### Step 1.3: Create PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)

**PRD.md must be detailed enough that anyone reading it can visualize EXACTLY what the app will be.**

Create a file `PRD.md` in the project root. Include **diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes** using ASCII/Mermaid:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
[What the product does, why it exists, problem it solves]

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Primary goal: ...
- Success metrics: ...
- Key differentiators from competitors: ...

## 3. Target Users
- User persona 1: [description, needs, pain points]
- User persona 2: [description, needs, pain points]

## 4. Features & Requirements

### Core Features (MVP)
- [ ] Feature 1: [detailed description with acceptance criteria]
- [ ] Feature 2: [detailed description with acceptance criteria]

### Nice-to-have (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Feature A: [description]

## 5. User Flows (REQUIRED)

### Main User Flow
(Use ASCII or Mermaid diagram)
```
[Start] → [Action 1] → [Decision?] → [Yes: Action 2] → [End]
                           ↓
                      [No: Action 3]
```

## 6. Wireframes (REQUIRED for UI apps)

### Screen 1: [Name]
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo]          [Nav] [User]   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│   [Main Content Area]           │
│                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Footer]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Screen 2: [Name]
[ASCII wireframe...]

## 7. Data Models (REQUIRED)

### Entity Relationship Diagram
```
┌──────────┐       ┌──────────┐
│  User    │ 1───N │  Order   │
├──────────┤       ├──────────┤
│ id       │       │ id       │
│ name     │       │ user_id  │
│ email    │       │ total    │
└──────────┘       └──────────┘
```

### Schema Details
- **User**: id, name, email, created_at
- **Order**: id, user_id, total, status, created_at

## 8. Technical Architecture

### System Diagram
```
[Client] ←→ [API Server] ←→ [Database]
                ↓
          [External APIs]
```

### Docker Infrastructure (docker-compose.yml)
| Service | Image       | Purpose          | Port |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| db      | postgres:16 | Main database    | 5432 |
| cache   | redis:7     | Caching/sessions | 6379 |
| ...     | ...         | ...              | ...  |

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: [choice + justification]
- **Framework**: [choice + justification]
- **Database**: [Docker image + justification]
- **Other Services**: [Docker images used]

## 9. API Design (if applicable)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Request | Response |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| /users   | GET    | List users  | -       | User[]   |
| /users   | POST   | Create user | User    | User     |

## 10. UI/UX Guidelines
- Color scheme: ...
- Typography: ...
- Component library: ...
- Responsive breakpoints: ...

## 11. Research Sources
- [Link 1]: Key insight learned
- [Link 2]: Key insight learned
```

**PRD Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] User can visualize the app from wireframes
- [ ] Data flow is clear from diagrams
- [ ] All features have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tech choices are justified

### Step 1.4: Update or Create AI Tool Configuration File

Detect the current AI coding tool and update/create the appropriate configuration file in the project root.

**Detection: Run the bundled script**

Execute the detection script to determine which AI tool is running:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/vibe-builder/scripts/detect-ai-tool.sh
```

The script returns one of: `CLAUDE`, `GEMINI`, or `UNKNOWN`.

| Result    | Action                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE`  | Create/update `CLAUDE.md`                  |
| `GEMINI`  | Create/update `GEMINI.md`                  |
| `UNKNOWN` | Ask the Human which AI tool they are using |

**Section to add/merge** (use header `# Claude Code Project Rules` or `# Gemini Project Rules` if creating new file):

```markdown
## Vibe Builder Project Reference

### Primary Documentation
- `PRD.md` - Full product requirements (read when detailed specs needed)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Task tracking with checkboxes
- `TEST_PLAN.md` - Test cases and results (created in Phase 4)

### Coding Guidelines
- Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for tasks
- Use typed language as specified in PRD.md
- Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
- Keep code minimal and focused

### Context Management
- This file = quick rules for coding sessions
- PRD.md = full details (always lazy-read this PRD.md file when needed informations about current Product, it so long that need lazy-read partly for saving tokens of context window)
```

**Important:** If file exists, append this section. Never overwrite existing rules.

### Step 1.5: Create IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Create a file `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with detailed implementation tasks:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize project with [framework/tool]
- [ ] Configure TypeScript/type checking
- [ ] Setup linting and formatting
- [ ] Configure build tools

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] Setup state management

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation
- [ ] Feature 1
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.1
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.2
- [ ] Feature 2
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.1
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.2

## Phase 4: UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Styling and theming
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integration testing

## Progress Log
| Date    | Phase    | Status      | Notes                |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| [today] | Planning | In Progress | Initial plan created |
```

### Step 1.6: Present Summary

Present a brief summary to the Human:
- Key findings from research
- Recommended technology stack
- Core features identified
- Estimated complexity

**STOP and wait for Human to review PRD.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 2: Planning & Review (Human in the Loop)

**Goal:** Ensure the plan aligns with Human expectations before coding.

### Step 2.1: Receive Feedback

The Human will review the documentation and may request:
- Feature additions or removals
- Technology stack changes
- Priority adjustments
- Clarifications on requirements

### Step 2.2: Update Documentation

Update `PRD.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` based on feedback:
- Revise features as requested
- Adjust technical decisions
- Add missing requirements
- Remove unnecessary items
- Also update `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` if rules need adjustment

### Step 2.3: Confirm Technology

Verify the technology stack meets these requirements:
- **Typed language** (TypeScript, Rust, Python with type hints)
- Appropriate for the app type
- Human is comfortable with the choice

### Step 2.4: Request Final Approval

Present the updated documentation and ask:
- "Is the PRD accurate and complete?"
- "Is the implementation plan acceptable?"
- "Are you ready to proceed with coding?"

**STOP and wait for Human approval. Do NOT proceed to coding without explicit approval.**

---

## PHASE 3: Agentic Coding (Autonomous Execution)

**Goal:** Implement the application following the approved plan.

**CRITICAL: FULLY AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION**

Human has already approved everything in Phase 1-2. All requirements, features, and technical decisions are finalized. Now you execute **autonomously and continuously** until the product is complete.

**YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING:**
- DO NOT ask Human to setup Docker, databases, or any infrastructure
- DO NOT ask Human to install dependencies or configure tools
- DO NOT ask Human to create files, folders, or configs
- YOU setup everything yourself based on PRD.md specifications

### Step 3.1: Project Setup (YOU DO IT ALL)

**Setup everything autonomously - NEVER ask Human to do setup tasks:**

1. **Create project structure** - Initialize folders, configs, package.json, etc.
2. **Create docker-compose.yml** - Based on PRD.md infrastructure spec:
   - Write the complete docker-compose.yml file
   - Include all services (db, cache, etc.) from PRD.md
   - Configure ports, volumes, environment variables
3. **Start Docker services** - Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. **Install dependencies** - Run npm/pip/cargo install
5. **Configure build tools** - Setup TypeScript, linters, formatters
6. **Initialize database** - Run migrations, seed data if specified

Mark `[x]` immediately after each task.

**If Docker/service fails:** Debug and fix it yourself. Check logs, adjust configs, retry.

### Step 3.2: Context Sync Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Re-read documentation frequently to stay on-track:**

```
EVERY 3-5 TASKS:
  1. Re-read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - check current progress
  2. Re-read relevant PRD.md section - verify implementation matches spec
  3. Ensure you're building what was specified, not drifting
```

**When implementing a feature:**
1. FIRST: Read the feature spec from PRD.md
2. THEN: Implement exactly as specified
3. AFTER: Verify implementation matches PRD.md

### Step 3.3: Core Implementation (CONTINUOUS)

**Work non-stop through IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:**

```
LOOP until all tasks complete:
  1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - find next uncompleted task [ ]
  2. Read relevant PRD.md section for that task
  3. Implement the task exactly as specified
  4. Mark [x] immediately in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
  5. Every 3-5 tasks: Full context sync (re-read both docs)
  6. Continue to next task (NO stopping)
```

**Do NOT stop to ask Human** - everything is already defined in PRD.md.

### Step 3.4: Parallel Execution

Maximize speed by running independent tasks in parallel:
- Multiple components with no dependencies
- Tests alongside implementation
- Docker services setup while coding

### Step 3.5: Progress Reporting (Brief)

After completing each **major phase** (not every task), report briefly:
```
✅ Completed: [Phase name]
📋 Next: [Next phase]
```

Keep reports minimal - focus on coding, not reporting.

### Step 3.6: Handle Blockers (SELF-RESOLVE)

**NEVER ask Human to do technical tasks. Resolve everything yourself:**

| Blocker Type        | Action                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Docker won't start  | Check logs, fix config, restart             |
| Dependency conflict | Resolve versions, update package.json       |
| Build error         | Read error, fix code, rebuild               |
| Missing config      | Create the config file yourself             |
| Database connection | Check docker-compose, fix connection string |
| Unknown technology  | WebSearch for docs, learn, implement        |

**Only ask Human if:**
- Business requirement is unclear (not in PRD.md)
- Need Human decision on product direction
- PRD.md has conflicting requirements

**Default behavior: Keep coding. Solve problems yourself. Don't stop.**

Continue until ALL IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md tasks are marked `[x]`.

---

## PHASE 4: Testing Setup

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive test plan before executing tests.

### Step 4.1: Stop New Features

Do NOT add new features. Focus only on testing and quality.

### Step 4.2: Create TEST_PLAN.md

Create a file `TEST_PLAN.md` with detailed test cases:

```markdown
# Test Plan

## Unit Tests
- [ ] Test: [Component/Function name] - [What it tests]
- [ ] Test: [Component/Function name] - [What it tests]

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Test: [Feature/Flow name] - [What it tests]

## UI/E2E Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Test: [User flow] - [Steps and expected result]

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Test: [Edge case description]

## Performance Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Test: [What to measure]

---

## Test Results
| Test | Status  | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| ...  | PENDING | ...   |
```

### Step 4.3: Present Test Plan

Summarize the test coverage:
- Number of unit tests planned
- Key integration tests
- Critical user flows to test

**STOP and wait for Human to review TEST_PLAN.md. Human may add missing test cases.**

---

## PHASE 5: Testing Execution

**Goal:** Execute tests, fix errors, ensure quality.

**AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION - Run continuously until all tests pass.**

### Step 5.1: Type/Syntax Checking

Run type checker and compiler continuously:
```
LOOP until no errors:
  1. Run build/compile
  2. Fix all type/syntax errors
  3. Re-run
```

### Step 5.2: Execute Tests & Auto-Fix (CONTINUOUS)

**Run all tests, auto-fix, repeat until green:**
```
LOOP until all tests pass:
  1. Run test suite
  2. For each failure:
     - Identify root cause from error message
     - Implement fix immediately
     - Re-run tests
  3. Mark results in TEST_PLAN.md
  4. Continue until 100% pass (don't stop to ask)
```

### Step 5.3: UI Testing (if applicable)

If app has UI, verify:
- All user flows work
- Visual elements render correctly
- Responsive on different sizes

### Step 5.4: Quality Report

Present final test results:
```
Test Summary:
- Unit Tests: X/Y passed
- Integration Tests: X/Y passed
- UI Tests: X/Y passed

Issues Found and Fixed: [list]
Remaining Issues: [list if any]
```

---

## PHASE 6: Fine-tune & Loop

**Goal:** Iterate and improve based on Human feedback.

### Step 6.1: Receive Change Requests

The Human may request:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring

### Step 6.2: Update Documentation FIRST

**CRITICAL: Always update documentation before coding changes.**

1. Update `PRD.md` with new/modified requirements
2. Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with new tasks
3. Update `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` if coding rules need changes
4. Present changes to Human

### Step 6.3: Wait for Confirmation

Show the Human what will change and ask:
- "These are the planned changes. Proceed?"

**STOP and wait for Human confirmation before implementing.**

### Step 6.4: Implement Changes

Once confirmed:
1. Execute the new tasks
2. Mark checkboxes as complete
3. Report progress

### Step 6.5: Re-run Tests

After changes:
1. Run type checker
2. Execute relevant tests from TEST_PLAN.md
3. Fix any regressions
4. Report results

### Step 6.6: Loop

Return to Step 6.1 if Human has more changes.

Continue the loop until Human is satisfied with the product.

---

## Rules

### Autonomous Execution Rules
1. **Full Self-Setup** - YOU setup everything: Docker, databases, configs, dependencies. NEVER ask Human to do setup tasks.
2. **Context Sync Every 3-5 Tasks** - Re-read PRD.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md frequently to stay on-track. Don't drift from spec.
3. **Self-Resolve Blockers** - Debug and fix technical issues yourself. Only ask Human about unclear business requirements.
4. **Continuous Coding** - Once Human approves in Phase 2, code NON-STOP until complete. Don't ask questions - answers are in PRD.md.
5. **Human Checkpoints** - STOP only at Phase 1, 2, and 4. Phase 3 & 5 are FULLY AUTONOMOUS.

### Research & Documentation Rules
6. **Deep Research First** - ALWAYS do thorough WebSearch (5-8 searches) before writing PRD. Understand the domain deeply.
7. **Visual PRD** - PRD.md MUST include wireframes, flowcharts, ER diagrams. User must visualize the app from PRD alone.
8. **Single Source of Truth** - PRD.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md are the authoritative documents.
9. **Documentation First** - In Phase 6, always update documentation before coding.

### Technical Rules
10. **Docker-First Infrastructure** - Prioritize Docker images for services (db, cache, auth, search). Setup and run them yourself.
11. **Typed Languages Only** - Always use typed programming languages (TypeScript, Rust, Python+types)
12. **Auto-select Stack** - Choose appropriate technology based on app type if not specified
13. **Auto-fix Errors** - Automatically fix errors and re-test. Don't stop to ask.

### Progress Tracking Rules
14. **Incremental Progress** - Mark checkbox `[x]` immediately when completing a task
15. **Parallel Execution** - Leverage parallel tasks when possible for efficiency
16. **Lean Reports** - Keep status reports brief and actionable
17. **Reference Code** - Use `file_path:line_number` format when discussing code

### Configuration Rules
18. **AI Tool Detection** - Create CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, GEMINI.md for Antigravity
19. **Preserve Existing Config** - If CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md already exists, append/merge new sections; never overwrite existing rules
20. **Minimal Changes** - Don't over-engineer; implement exactly what's needed
